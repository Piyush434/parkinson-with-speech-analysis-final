# Parkinson's Disease Detection Using Speech Analysis

This repository contains the research project for the final year, focusing on the early detection of Parkinson's disease through the analysis of speech signals. The project utilizes machine learning models to identify vocal biomarkers associated with the disease.

## Abstract

Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that affects motor skills, and speech impairment is a common early symptom. This research explores the potential of using speech analysis as a non-invasive, accessible, and cost-effective method for early diagnosis. By leveraging a dataset of voice recordings from both healthy individuals and Parkinson's patients, this project develops and evaluates various machine learning algorithms to build a robust predictive model. The findings, detailed in the accompanying research paper and project report, demonstrate the viability of this approach in distinguishing between healthy and affected individuals.
